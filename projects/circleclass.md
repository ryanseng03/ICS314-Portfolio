### Circle Class

In ICS 212, one of our last assignments in C++ was to create an abstract data type named Circle which would include data members and functions that a circle would have.

This would require the use of accessor and mutator functions to get and set values of a circle such as its radius and area.

There would also have to be a derived class, Cylinder, which inherits the attributes of a circle, the only different would be the calculation in volume and area would have to differ.

Through this project I learned to use my knowledge that I have attained throughout the semester, utilizing different data types and variables to achieve a satisfactory score. Since there would be many lines in the code, this pushed me to write brief, but detailed comments throughout and organizing the code with proper formatting and spacing.

In the end, I left feeling very satisfied that I was able to create something of my own without any peer help and just using the tools at my disposal.
