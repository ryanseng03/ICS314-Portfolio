Our goal, to party.

We needed to plan thouroughly.

Creating an interary document seemed like a great idea. It probably took us about three hours to figure out what we needed to buy, the hotel we want to stay at and what activities we should do during our residence there.

I mapped out an hour by hour plan on the locations we should go to and what are our goals there and by what time we should finish.

Once we came back....
