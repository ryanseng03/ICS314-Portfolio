## Infant Stages

An easy career path for an Asian growing up was either Doctor or Lawyer. Pretty strict standards for a lot of us. It was in elementary school, where I became more and more interested in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. The first iPhone was unveiled, advances in mobile computing machines were booming and YouTube was going mainstream. I then got my first computer, an iMac G3.

Just playing around with the different windows on my computer and tablet, allowed me to grasp so much information, to the point where I became so proficient in the interface, some of my family members would ask me for help with their devices… I was about six years old.

I always felt like I was pretty good with technology. I could pick something up and figure out the ins and outs of it quite fast. I was always someone who would try to learn something on my own with resources like YouTube or reading things online. I never liked asking for help or assistance if I knew I could do it myself.

## Retrospectively

Come middle school, parent-teacher conferences. We have to write our goals, evaluate our performances and talk about it awkwardly. After school, I would watch various vlogs and reviews on different things. One of them being, “A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer”. There were a lot of videos involving someone’s day in their lives, but not too many at the time of being a Software Engineer. It sounded like such a new thing at the time, and the content was like nothing I have ever seen before.

Workplaces that look like a child’s daycare mixed with a contemporary, but modern office. Frequent collaboration with colleagues through meetings, or just talking with the person sitting next to you. Going to coffee shops in the middle of the day, then doing more work away from the office. Coming back and taking a nap, or playing ping pong, or riding scooters around the hallways. Insane, that someone could just work there and get paid lucratively.

Of course those are just possible benefits if you are in the right situation. Over the years, I have focused less on those perks, and more on how sustainable it is. Will I be burnt out after a while? Will I be happy? Questions I have yet to know the answer to, however some things do intrigue me.

I do not like living in monotony. Even the route I take to school is usually different every other day. Eating the same food, or just staying at home, doing nothing drives me crazy. Do I think this will affect my interest in this career field?

## Present Day

So far… no.

Solving problems to code is quite enjoyable. I get a shot of dopamine when I finish my coding homework, knowing that I created this myself. Or when a problem is so difficult that it takes me multiple hours just to get the code running properly… finally cracking it out, it’s like a drug. That is what I have been loving so far, just the grind, and the different aspects of software, not just mindlessly typing out functions and variables over and over. Working with other people, and bouncing ideas off of each other. 

Therefore, I keep going. I will strive to achieve my goals. So on, I will live a fulfilling life, because of software.
