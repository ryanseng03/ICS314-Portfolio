# Design Patterns to the Rescue!

*"I don't know how to design this website! What will I ever do!?"*

## A shift in thinking
Think of design patterns as handy templates in programming. They're like proven shortcuts to common problems developers face when building software. These patterns help in organizing code better, making it easier to manage and expand. Imagine them as recipes that chefs follow to create delicious dishes; developers use these patterns to create efficient and reliable software.

## Singleton
One such pattern is the "Singleton," which ensures there's only one of something in the entire program. It's like having a magic potion that guarantees only one instance of an object exists. I used this pattern to make sure there's only one function in a file that has one intention for other files, avoiding confusion and keeping things consistent.

## Observer
Another useful pattern is the "Observer." It's like a busy town square where different things are happening, and everyone's watching and reacting to a main event. I used this pattern to create a system where various parts of the program react to changes in data in real-time, like getting instant notifications and being able to change it from another page.

## Strategy
Then there's the "Strategy" pattern, which is like having a toolbox with different tools for different jobs. I used this pattern to switch between data structures and frameworks as I saw what each page would need to use for it to be well designed.

## All in all
So, by using patterns like Singleton, Observer, and Strategy, I've made my code more organized and flexible. They're like secret ingredients that help in solving problems and making software work better. Just like chefs have recipes, developers have these design patterns to create reliable and smart solutions for software challenges.
